To build a complete search engine for academic papers, you'll need to add:

Backend Components:

- Database (e.g., PostgreSQL) to store paper metadata and abstracts
- API server (e.g., FastAPI/Flask) to handle requests
- Paper indexing system (e.g., Elasticsearch) for efficient search
- PDF processing pipeline to extract text/metadata from papers


Additional Parsers:

- arXiv parser for preprints
- PDF text extraction
- Citation graph parser
- Author disambiguation


Search Features:

- Full-text search
- Author search
- Citation network analysis
- Topic modeling/clustering
- Paper recommendations
- Advanced filters (citations, date ranges, etc.)

User Features:

- User accounts
- Paper collections/libraries
- Citation management
- Email alerts for new papers
